## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Alexander-Jessop/climbing-blog.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the Project Directory:

   ```bash
   cd climbing-blog
   ```

3. Set Up a Virtual Environment: It's a good practice to work within a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies. You can create one using Python's built-in venv module:

   ```bash
   py -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the Virtual Environment:

   ```bash
   source venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

5. Install Project Dependencies: Use pip to install the required Python packages listed in the requirements.txt file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Project Locally

To run the Climbing Blog locally, make sure you've completed the "Getting Started" steps and have activated your virtual environment. Then, you can start the Django development server:

```bash
py manage.py runserver
```

The development server will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your web browser. You can explore the climbing blog and its features locally.

## Logging In to the Admin Panel

To access the admin panel, you'll need to create a superuser account. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
py manage.py createsuperuser
```

You'll be prompted to enter a username, email address, and password for your superuser account. Once you've created a superuser, you can log in to the admin panel.

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

## Credentials

A superuser has already been created for the instructor to access the admin panel. The credentials are as follows:

- Username: instructor
- Password: DjangoRocks1!

## Assignment Requirements

### Assignment 1

Assignment - Create & deploy a Django project

In this course, you will create a fully-functional blog which using Python and the Django framework. Each assignment will add new features to this project to ultimately produce a fully-featured web app. This assignment lays the foundation for the entire course and all subsequent assignments.

Use the mysite project built in this module as reference.
Requirements

Pick a topic for a blog. It could be a personal blog, or related to a special topic or interest.

    Set up your GitHub account if you have not already

    Create a new Django project - different than the one used in the course modules. In your ~/PycharmProjects folder, run:

    $ django-admin startproject <project-name> .

    Use snake_case naming for the Django project.

    Use the standard, out-of-box, sqlite3 database (db.sqlite3) to store data.

    Create an index view (at /) with an accompanying test to demonstrate a 200 HTTP response status code.

    Your app will be run locally on your (and the instructor's) machine. The website must run using python manage.py runserver
    Share github repo (public) for this assignment with the instructor

### Assignment 3

#### Assignment Description

For this assignment, you are tasked to style your base template using CSS. You will create a look & feel that best suits your taste and the content of your site. The design portion is a creative exercise, but technical considerations covered in this module will be evaluated.

#### Tasks

1. Create a base template with at least one content block which is styled using CSS.

2. Create a home page (view & template) which extends the base template.

3. Render the list of topics contained in the Topic model in a sidebar.

   - Include the total number of posts for each topic (hint: use query annotations). You may display topics without posts â€“ they will have a count of 0.
   - Order the list by the most popular topic (most posts).
   - Limit to the top 10 topics.

4. Ensure that there is sample data in your site's database to appropriately render content.

#### Evaluation Criteria

- Base template structure & design: /3
- At least one content block which is styled using CSS: /3
- Create a home page (view & template) which extends the base template: /3
- Render the list of topics: /3
- Ensure that there is sample data in your site's database to appropriately render content: /3

#### Grade Explanation

- 3: Criteria is met and all functionality is present.
- 2: Criteria is mostly met with some gaps in functionality.
- 1: Criteria is mostly unsatisfied or not functional, though some elements are present.
- 0: Criteria is not met. No visible attempt to satisfy it exists.

### Assignment 4

This assignment continues to build upon your blog project.

In this assignment, we will build pages for Topics. We will create a list view for all the topics which will link to detailed views. The detailed view will consist of a list of posts which are about the provided topic.

#### Requirements

1. **Move global queries to context_processors**

   Move the top topics list query to the `blog.context_processors.base_context` function created in this module. This will expose the top topics on all the site pages.

2. **Build a topic ListView**

   Create a `ListView` that renders all topics defined in the database.

   - Define the URL at `/topics/`. Note the trailing slash.
   - List the topics alphabetically
   - Link the topic to the topic detail view
   - Set the page title block

3. **Build a topic DetailView**

   Create a `DetailView` for the topic

   - Define the URL as `/topics/<slug:slug>/`. Note the trailing slash.
   - Render a list of posts filtered by this topic. This should be formatted like the post previews on the home & post list pages.
   - Only published posts should appear
   - Posts should be ordered by latest to earliest published date

   ##### Hints:

   - Overriding the `get_context_data()` method of the `DetailView` allows the customization of the context variables to the template
   - To access the topic object from the `DetailView`, use the `self.get_object()` method. Alternatively, you can get the `pk` value from `self.kwargs`.
   - Can you use an existing template component/partial to render the post previews?

4. **Define `get_absolute_url` on the Topic model**

   Define and return the appropriate URL for the topic object.

   _Hint:_ use the `reverse()` function to construct the string.

5. **Link topics to their detailed page on the site**

   The topics sidebar:

   - Add a link for each top topic which will bring the user to the topic detail view using the `get_absolute_url`.
   - Add a link to "view all" topics

   The main navigation:

   - Add a link to "Topics"

   The post detail page:

   - Each post has related topics. List these on the post detail page
   - Link each topic to their pages

#### Evaluation

### Assignment 5

This assignment adds another feature to your blog website which will collect and save user data and an image to the database as part of a hypothetical photo contest.

Add a link to the contest in the main navigation bar which will take users to a page describing the contest and containing a form in which they can upload their information and photo submission.

The required pieces of information to gather from the user are

    Their name
    Their email address
    An image

In addition to the information gathered, also save the date & time of the submission.

Register the model in the Django admin and customize its presentation so it can be sorted, filtered, etc. by a staff member of your site.

#### Hints:

- To upload files in a form you must set the encoding to "multipart/form-data" by adding the following to the <form> tag: <form enctype="multipart/form-data" ... >
